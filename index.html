                Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you,
                you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I
                suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough
                that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears!
                It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who
                you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger,
                Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and
                you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!

              When you have children, you always have family. They will always be your priority, your responsibility. And a man, a man provides. And he does it even when he’s not appreciated or respected or even loved. He simply bears up and he does it. Because he’s a man. <br><br>

            I have spent my whole life scared. Frightened of things that could
            happen; might happen; might not happen. 50 years I've spent like
            that. Finding myself awake at 3am. But you know what? Ever since my
            diagnosis, I sleep just fine. I came to realize it's that fear is
            the worst of it, that's the real enemy. So, get up, get out in the
            real world and you kick that bastard as hard as you can, right in
            the teeth.
